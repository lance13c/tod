## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **File storage scalability** → Start with filesystem, plan for S3 migration
2. **Location accuracy** → Implement fallback options, clear error messages
3. **Session code collisions** → Use robust generation algorithm, add retry logic

### Timeline Risks
1. **OAuth setup delays** → Can launch with email-only initially
2. **Mobile testing complexity** → Use BrowserStack or similar service
3. **Docker deployment issues** → Have fallback PM2 deployment ready
